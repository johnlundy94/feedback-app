# Feedback App

## Description

Creating this React application was key to understanding the foundations of React.
This project was built so that I would have an additional project to reference when creating future full stack applications.
The Feedback App is an intuitive app that can be implemented in a businesses website to gain feedback on their product or service.
Walking through Brad Traversy's explanation was extremely helpful. Understanding React and its components is becoming easier and easier.
